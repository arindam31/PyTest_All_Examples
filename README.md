# Introduction

The project aims to show Pytest used for testing different kinds of test subjects

## Project Structure
Every test is for a specific subject. It can be a web page, a mocked hardware, or a backend service.
We start our services and then run tests against them.

## How to run tests:
- While inside a domain folder, instructions for running test and the product server (if needed) are mentioned in the readme file.
- Create a venv from the base requirements.txt file in root of project.
- Then additional Installation packages required are also mentioned in included requirements.txt file. Install them on top of our earlier venv.

## Projects Tested
- Mock Embdded Generic Device running GRPC server with services.
