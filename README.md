# Introduction

The project aims to show Pytest used for testing different kinds of test subjects

## Project Structure
Every test is for a specific subject. It can be a web page, a mocked hardware, or a backend service.
We start our services and then run tests against them.

## How to run tests:

```
pytest test_practise.py
```

## For running tests with coverage:
```
python3 -m pytest --cov
```
